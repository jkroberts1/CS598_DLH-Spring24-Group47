## Running Instructions
1. Ensure all required packages are in the Python environment.
2. Use the link to the Google Drive below to obtain pretrained models and post/pre processing data.
3. Ensure this is run using Google Colab Pro or equivalent GPU setup.
4. If running locally remove the mounting of the Google Drive cells from the notebook.
### Steps To Run Model Evaluation
Follow these steps just to evaluate the model (This will not preprocessing or training)
1. Use the project evaluation python notebook.
2. Ensure the path to the pretrained models and input data are valid.
3. Run each code block except those related to training.
4. Be sure to run loading of the models before evaluation.
### Steps to Run Both Notebooks
Follow these steps to run preprocessing data all the way to the end of model evaluation.
1. Start from the project preprocessing python notebook.
2. Ensure the path to the input data is valid.
3. Run all cells in preprocessing.
4. Move over to project evaluation python notebook.
5. Run all cells in evalutaion (training will take about an hour)
